# The Void
JavaScript (client-server) MIDI sequencer


## Dependencies
[NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/) - Midi

[Jurassic](https://github.com/paulbartrum/jurassic) - JavaScript Engine

## Why

To begin with I wanted create a client-server environment that was suitable for 'live' coding/jamming so I could make music or experiment faster and be DAW agnostic. 
The result is a JavaScript MIDI sequencer outside of the browser.
